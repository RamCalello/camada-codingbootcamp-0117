            Jacques Berman Webster II (born April 30, 1992), known
            professionally as Travis Scott (formerly stylized as Travi$ Scott),
            is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. In
            2012, Scott signed his first major-label deal with Epic Records. In
            November of the same year, Scott signed a deal with Kanye West's
            GOOD Music, as part of its production wing Very GOOD Beats. In April
            2013, Scott signed a record deal with T.I.'s Grand Hustle imprint.
            Scott's first full-length project, the mixtape Owl Pharaoh, was
            self-released in 2013. It was followed with a second mixtape, Days
            Before Rodeo, in August 2014. His debut studio album, Rodeo (2015),
            was led by the hit single "Antidote". His second album, Birds in the
            Trap Sing McKnight (2016) became his first number one album on the
            Billboard 200. The following year, Scott released a collaborative
            album with Quavo titled Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho under the group
            name Huncho Jack. In 2018, his highly anticipated Astroworld was
            released to widespread critical acclaim and produced his first
            Billboard Hot 100 number one single, "Sicko Mode". In late 2019,
            Scott's record label Cactus Jack Records released the compilation
            album JackBoys which became the first number one album on the
            Billboard 200 of the 2020s. Scott's musical style has been described
            as a fusion of traditional hip hop, lo-fi and ambient. Scott has
            sold over 45 million certified records in the US alone. He has been
            nominated for six Grammy Awards and won a Billboard Music Award.

          <h2>Inside the album</h2>
          <p>
            AstroWorld was torn down in 2005, and Travis Scott never quite got
            over it. After all, the closing of Houston’s infamous Six Flags
            theme park was what prompted him to start making music in the first
            place. That being said, it should only be natural that he name his
            third studio album after the landmark; he even noted AstroWorld’s
            closing in an interview with GQ as the instance that “took all the
            fun out of [Houston.]” Travis Scott’s first promise of “Astroworld”
            came in 2016, which makes it safe to say that this might be one of
            the most anticipated releases of the year. The hype was enough to
            feed even more into the ominous mystique that surrounded his
            breakthrough albums, “Rodeo” and “Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight,”
            with fans thinking, hoping, and praying that any moment now, Scott
            could be releasing “Astroworld.” And now that the wait is over, fans
            are being met with Travis Scott at his absolute best. Although the
            17 track album as a whole is truly impressive, it’s safe to predict
            that the first five tracks will be (mark my words) the main singles
            that get the most streams and radio play. Almost all of the five
            songs switch pace and thought process mid-track, the seamless
            transition of each song leading onto the next like a storyline.
            “Stargazing” is menacing, a dreamlike opener to the album that leads
            to the equally dangerous “Carousel,” which features Frank Ocean.
            Things start to get real, however, on “Sicko Mode,” where Drake’s
            guest spot is a mere afterthought compared to Scott’s verse; the
            jarring funk of the beat change is incredible. It’s worth noting
            that this album also boasts one of the most impressive guest lists
            of the year, with Stevie Wonder lending his harmonica skills on
            “Stop Trying to Be God,” Pharell and Tame Impala on “Skeletons,” and
            John Mayer and Thundercat on “Astrothunder.” The Quavo and Takeoff
            guest spots on “Who? What?” might have been enough to singlehandedly
            save the disaster that was 2017’s “Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho,” had it
            been featured on the disappointed collaboration. “Butterfly Effect”
            is still as much of a standout track on the album as it was when it
            was released as a single in 2017, but it’s tracks like “Coffee Bean”
            that really make Scott’s artistry stand out. Not only does the song
            have an unforgettable beat, but it’s a brutally honest verse,
            focusing on brooding introversion relating to his relationship with
            Kylie Jenner. At one point, he fearfully envisions himself facing a
            divorce court, battling for custody over his daughter with Jenner.
            But despite an uncertain future in mind, Travis Scott has definitely
            found his place in stardom with “Astroworld.” While it started as a
            Tweeted promise, it also fueled an unreal amount of hype. But any
            doubts of “Astroworld”’s ability to live up to expectations should
            be tossed. Scott really does treat this album like a literal theme
            park, if you’ll excuse the analogy, employing the guest list like
            side-attractions while also making it crucially clear that he is the
            main event. So finally, 13 years after AstroWorld’s devastating
            shutdown in Houston, Travis Scott’s own storied “Astroworld” is
            here. And it was definitely worth the wait.
